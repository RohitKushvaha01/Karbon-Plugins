### Steps to Publish a Plugin:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**  
   First, make a new repository on GitHub where you will store the files for your plugin.

2. **Add Plugin Files to Your Repository**  
   Upload all the necessary files for your plugin into the newly created repository. You can refer to an [Example Plugin](https://github.com/RohitKushvaha01/HelloWorld-Plugin-Example) to see how it should be done.

3. **Fork the Karbon-Plugins Repository**  
   Go to this Karbon-Plugins repository and create a fork (a personal copy of the repository).

4. **Add Your Plugin Repository Link to `repo.json`**  
   In your forked repository, find the `repo.json` file. Add the link to your plugin’s GitHub repository into this file so it can be included in the Karbon project.

5. **Create a Pull Request**  
   Once you’ve made the changes, submit a pull request to the original Karbon-Plugins repository, requesting that your changes (your plugin link) be merged.

6. After Successful merge your plugin will be visible in the app
